    <h2>
      Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
      you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
      made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
    </h2>

    <p>
      At one point in my career, I had a colleague who made some patronising
      comments, and inferred that certain people were beneath him, or that he
      could use his position or rank to get more perks or benefits compared to
      other people. This is something that bothered me for a long time. The
      ethical decision that I had to make was whether to confront that person
      and those comments, or whether to ignore them. Essentially, I ended up
      giving that person the feedback directly. This links into an ethic that I
      hold of people treating others equally and fairly regardless of their
      position or rank.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
      values and identity.
    </h2>

    <p>
      I have been heavily influenced by my parents and my religious upbrining.
      While not religious myself, a lot of those stories, values, and
      experiences have stayed with me into my 30s. It is difficult now to
      separate the values that are 'mine' vs those that were 'given to me', and
      a whole nother layer of deeper questions like - whats the difference
      between mine and my parents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Essentially now I have my own values, and they are also influencedby other
      people like my wife, as well as peers and colleagues, and other people I
      admire.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning
      journey.
    </h2>

    <p>
      One key strength is having an inquisitive mind. Knowing that problems or
      questions that exist can have solutions, whether they be emotional,
      relational, or technical solutions.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
      development. How might these affect your learning journey?
    </h2>

    <p>
      Some personal limitations that I have are to do with how much time I want
      to commit to work. I would like to enjoy my work and be fulfilled by it,
      but not to let it dominate my life. Essentially this boils down to
      maintaining a work / life balance.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others,
      but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the
      time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other
      strategies you would try now and why.
    </h2>

    <p>
      I remember working on shared assignments at university with people who
      would not pull their weight. I found this confronting and difficult,
      especially as the grades were the same for everyone whether they were a
      full contributor or not contributing at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember my own personal strategy in these situations was a
      non-confrotational approach, where I would prefer to either a) work extra
      hard to compensate for the slacking person if I wanted a good grade, or b)
      stoop down to that other persons level of effrt (if I was not concerned as
      much about the grade.)
    </p>
    <p>
      In hindsight, I should have probably confronted these issues directly by
      providing feedback. This may have been more personally challenging, but
      ultimately it may have led to a more positive outcome without me holding
      onto personal resentment. In a group assignment, there is no obligation
      for someone to work hard, rather it becomes a personal expectation of the
      other person. By vocalising and exploring my own expectations of others,
      it may help to resolve issues, or otherwise agreeing to disagree, rather
      than 'suffering in silence'.
