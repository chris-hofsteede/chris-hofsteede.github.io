    <h2>Describe the difference between EQ and IQ</h2>

    <p>
      IQ (intellectual Quotient) has been the traditional measure of
      intelleigence, and traditionally thought to have the most impact on
      personal success. IQ related to intellectual ability, reasoning, problem
      solving skills, and has been using IQ tests for decades. IQ can be
      improved through memorisation techniquies, problem solving, and learning
      languages, among other things.
    </p>

    <p>
      EQ (entellectual Quotient) is a newer theory of intelligence that seeks to
      incorporate peoples' emotional skills and abilities into the idea of
      success and succeeding in life. The concept of EQ seeks to capture a
      persons ability to relate to others, identify emotions, show empathy, and
      regulate their own emotions as a way of showing intelligence and as a way
      to succeed or get ahead in life, careers and relationships. EQ can be
      measured using surveys (either self-assessed or peer-assessed). EQ can be
      improved through meditation, journalling, counselling, and other means.
    </p>

    <h2>Describe why EQ is important and how it is relevant to you</h2>

    <p>
      Emotional Intelligence is important as it forms the basis to how we work,
      engage, and support others. Emotional inteligence allows us to be humans,
      and to show our care, kindness, and compassion for others. Emotional
      intelligence cannot be separated from Intellectual Intelligence, as we
      cannot be successful in one area without having some skills in the other
      area. EQ + IQ is an example where the whole is greater than the sum of the
      parts, ie. 1 + 1 = 3
