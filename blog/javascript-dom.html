    <h2>What is the DOM?</h2>

    <p>
      The Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of objects that
      define the structure and layout of a website.
      <a
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction"
        >Link</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      The DOM is useful to us because it allows us to change and modify the
      content, and the way that a website is displayed. Using JavaScript, we are
      able to update, insert, change and modify a websites look, feel and
      content in a programatic manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an example, we could use JavaScript to select all "p" tags in the DOM,
      and make them dissapear, or change their colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a mirriad of JavaScript functions that allow us to access,
      update, and change objects in the DOM. As an example,
      "document.querySelectorAll("p")".
    </p>
    <p>
      JavaScript is not the only language that can be used to access the DOM,
      for example, python could also be used to modify objects in the DOM, and
      hence Python could also be used to create and manage websites. Django is
      an example of this.
    </p>

    <h2>What is the difference between the DOM and HTML?</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>HTML</strong> is the standard markup language for creating
      websites. It defines the content and structure of a website.
    </p>
    <p>The <strong>DOM</strong></p>
    is the programming interface for web documents. It is not the same as HTML,
    however the DOM can be used to create HTML documents for displaying on the
    web.
    <p>
      The DOM contais nodes which represent HTML elements, attributes or text.
    </p>

    <p>
      In summary, HTML is a markup language used to create web pages. DOM is a
      programming interface that represents a website, and can be changed
      programatically, which can then be displayed as HTML.
    </p>
    <p>
      The DOM represents the 'current state' of a website, so as we change the
      elements and nodes in the DOM, the browser reflects those changes in HTML
      and the website is updated accordingly.
