    <h2>Colours in CSS</h2>

    <div>
      <h3>Hexidecimal eg. #000000</h3>
      <p>
        Colours can be set using a 6 digit hexi-decimal code, where each digit
        ranges from 0 (zero) - f (fifteen), where #000000 is black, and #ffffff
        is white.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first digits represent the red channel, the second two, the green
        channel, and the third two the blue channel. This means that red is
        represented as <strong style="color: #ff0000">#ff000000</strong>, green
        as <strong style="color: #00ff00">#00ff00</strong> and blue as
        <strong style="color: #0000ff">#0000ff.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The number of colours available in each channel is 16 x 16 = 256, which
        means that in total there are 256 ^3 colour options in total, which is a
        whopping 16 777 216 colours to choose from.
      </p>
      <h3>3 digit Codes eg. #fff</h3>
      <p>
        To make things easier, we can also use 3 digit shorthand codes, with 1
        digit representing each colour channel.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example <strong id="bc1">#bc1</strong> is the same as the 6 digit
        code #bbcc11
      </p>
      <h3>Common Names</h3>
      <p>
        To make things easier again, some colours are given common names. While
        not all 16 777 216 colours have their own names, some common ones like
        <strong>#black</strong>,
        <strong style="color: white; background-color: black">#white</strong>,
        <strong style="color: #ff0000">#red</strong> do, as well as some more
        obscure ones like
        <strong style="color: greenyellow">#greenyellow</strong> and
        <strong style="color: maroon">#maroon.</strong> as well as
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS/Properties/color/keywords"
          >hundreds of others.</a
