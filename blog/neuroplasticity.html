    <h2>What is Neuroplasticity?</h2>
    <p>
      Neuroplasticity is the concept that our minds and our intelligence are not fixed, 
      and that they can grown and develop through mindful excercise or practise. 
    </p>
    <h2>How might one engage with the principles of neuroplasticity?</h2>
    <p>
      The concept of 'neurons that fire together, wire together', means that the more we 
      use certain pathways in the brain, the more they are strengthened and developed. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Techniques like practising mindfulness, and learning new things can develop our brains further. 
      Someone may do more puzzles, read books, learn a new skill or game, or play a lot of chess to develop their Neuroplasticity.
    </p>
    <h2>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h2>
    <p>
      As mentioned above, doing conscious excercises that challenge the brain can help to develop neuroplasticity. 
      Dev Academy is an example of doing regular excercises in Web Development that help to learn a new skill, and 
      develop a new strength in the brain that did not exist before.

        that can be used to develop neuroplasticity</a>

    <h2>Research Growth Mindset Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</h2>
    <p>
      Growth Mindset is a way of viewing challenges and setbacks. People with a Growth Mindset see challenges as things 
      that can be overcome through hard work and effort. In contrast, a Fixed Mindset would believe that one has the ability
      or not to overcome a challenge, regardless of effort. A Fixed Mindset person may then not bother to make an effort, believing
      that their effort will have no effect on the outcome. 
    </p>
    <h2>did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h2>
    <p>
      The concept of "Growth Mindset" is powerful to me, as I believe I have had a fixed mindset in a lot of areas previously. I 
      always felt that "being smart" is something that came naturally to me, rather than an outcome of the effort that I put in. Since
      learning about Growth Mindset, I am much more aware that I am able to overcome challenges through effort rather than relying on 
      natural ability. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I have used a growth mindset to challenge some ideas that I had about my own identity, such as "not being a good swimmer". Since
      I challenged this identity in my head, I have learned to become a competent swimmer through regular effort and training. 
    </p>
    <h2>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h2>
    <p>
      I will use this new knowledge to challenge myself when things get tough. Armed with the knowledge that I can overcome obstacles through 
      hard work and dedication, I will be able to rise to the challenge, rather than shy away from it.

      Growth Mindset, that I have been reading.
