    <h2>Tell me about when you were blocked on a simple problem:</h2>
    <p>
      One challenging problem I faced was adding a function expression to an
      object. <strong>Firstly,</strong> I didnt understand the idea of adding a
      function as a property, and <strong>secondly</strong> I was perplexed by
      the way that my solution worked.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can see in the image how athleteArray has 2 elements, with <div id="green">'Santa'</div> and
      '<div id="red">Chris</div>, however when I run the win() function, the output says <div id="red">'Chris won
      the High Jump event'</div> twice:
      </p>  
    <img src="../img/problem-solving1.png"></a>
    <p>My though progression was:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        At least the output is running twice, so that means both function calls
        are working.
      </li>
      <li>
        It seems like the values 'Chris' and 'High Jump' are persisting, even
        though I called the function with 'Santa' and 'delivery'.
      </li>
      <li>
        I tried to extract the variables into new variables to inject into the
        sting. This also didn't work.
      </li>
      <li>
        After a lot of trial and error, and reading a few articles, I went to
        ChatGPT:
      </li>
    </ul>
    <img src="../img/problem-solving2.png"></a>
    <p>
      The explaination from ChatGPT makes sense. Essentially, when the for loop
      runs, it keeps the final values of athleteArray[i].name and fsport =
      athleteArray[i].sport, which means that they are used then the win()
      function is used on both 'Santa' and 'Chris'.
    </p>

    <p>
      Essentially, the solution calls an outer function, that returns an inner
      function. The outer function has the values of 'Santa/delivery' and
      'Chris/High Jump', so that when the inner function is run, it is using
      those values at the time, rather than the final values of name and sport
      from once the for loop is finished running.
    </p>

    <p>
      I had not come across this topic before, which is called 'closure', which
      is to use the variable values at each pass of the for loop, rather than
      waiting for the final values from the loop. This was an interesting and
      good learning for me.
    </p>

    <h2>Explain when I elegantly solved a problem:</h2>

    <p>
      The challenge to return an array of strings and to join then with no spaces 
      was very short and simple. I enjoyed being able to solve it in one line using 
      the join() function:

    <h2>
      Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving
      techniques/processes:
    </h2>

    <h3>Pseudocode</h3>

    <p>
      I would say that I dont often use this technique except for reaaally difficult problems. 
      I would probably use it last in the case that I got really stuck. I can however understand 
      the benefits of breaking down a problem into steps and writing those steps down, as that 
      process seems to help the problem solving by itself. 
    </p>

    <h3>Trying something</h3>

    <p>
      This is probably my go-to approach, where I try something quickly to see if it will work. 
      Quite often it does not. lol. I guess on the other hand as I develop my skills, it could 
      be useful to just type in what I think, and I imagine with more experience, the solution 
      will gradually become more likely correct. 
    </p>

    <h3>Rubber ducky method</h3>

    <p>
      I like this method. Similar to Pseudocode, it helps to talk through a problem step by step. 
      I would say that I do not use this tool often, excet for the case when a problem is very very 
      difficult with a lot of difficult steps. 
    </p>

    <h3>Reading error messages</h3>

    <p>
      Error messages are useful. I read them often. I would say they are more useful for finding 
      punctuation mistakes, or missing brackets and colons. Error messages are not as useful for 
      solving complex problems, as the interpreter does not understand what it is that I am trying 
      to achieve, but mainly whether it is gramatically correct, and able to be run by the browser.  
    </p>

    <h3>Console.logging</h3>

    <p>
      I use console.log() often to see what is the value of an object or item at a given step. 
    </p>
    
    <h3>Googling</h3> 

    <p>
      I use googling often to search for solutions and explainations to technial questions. 
    </p>
    
    <h3>Asking your peers for help</h3>

    <p>
      To be honest, I am a bit of a lone ranger, so I would prefer to solve something myself, 
      than to ask anyone else. I will keep this in mind for future reference. 
    </p>
    
    <h3>Asking coaches for help</h3>
    
    <p>
      Same as above. I was considering asking a coach about the issue (top of page) until I found 
      the solution and explaination on ChatGPT. 
    </p>

    <h3>Improving your process with reflection</h3>

    <p>
      Reflecting has definitley helped in sharpening my decision making process, and understanding 
      how I learn, and solve problems. Writing reflections is time consuming, however it is worth the 
      time to cement the knowledge. 
    </p>
    
    <h2>
      Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made
      you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?
    </h2>

    <p>
      I would say that I am generally quite self sufficient (in life and coding) I guess I was brought 
      up to figure things out for myself (could be due to being from a big family). I think I have an 
      in-built desire not to 'bother' anyone.
    </p>
      
    <p>
      It is important for me to learn that other people are there to help, and that I can and should
      make use of those resouces to aid in my learning. 
    </p>
