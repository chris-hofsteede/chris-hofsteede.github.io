    <h2>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>
    <p>I have learned that 1) I am capable of learing new things through determined effort, and the main obstacle to learning is not my skill, 
      but rather finding motivation to sit down and focus on learning. This is a big challenge to my ego, because it removes all excuses and 
      makes me focus on finding drive to get something done. 
    </p>
    <p>2) I have learned to consider my values in decision making, and making sure that my decisions align with my identity and personal values.
      I think that decisions made in line with my values are good decisions, and it can only be a good thing in life to make more good decisions. 
    </p>
    <p>And 3) I have learned the power of active listening to someone elses story, and the power of repeating back the person what I have heard. 
      Often ego gets in the way when listening to other people, in that I am thinking of a response rather than thinking about what the person is 
      saying.  
    </p>
    <h2> What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming? </h2>
    <p>The EQ side of programming is vital in being able to communicate, understand others, and to be understood. At the end of the day all of
      our work has interactions with others, so we need to have the skills to work well with others. EQ is at least as important as IQ, if not more. 
    </p>
    <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning? </h2>
    <p>It was a good change to focus on the softer skills rather than purely programming skills. It made me reflect on what I was doing, and 
      how I was approaching problems. I think that being aware of the softer skills, as well as reflecting and communicating with others is a nice
      touch, and not something I have done much of previously in the technical learnign realm. 
    </p>
    <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning? </h2>
    <p>Some of the morechallenging parts were looking inside and being honest with myself. Some of the thoughts and conversations, and self challenges
      are the hardest conversations one can have. I found it tough to focus on what my motivations are, and challenge the way that I have made excuses 
      to learning. In reality I have the skills to do something, now I need to challenge myself, and remove excuses. That is the hard part. 
    </p>
    <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
    <p>Becuase the skills are equally important in the work place as coding skills are. A lot of workplace success will be determined in how we work with 
      others. This is why ( I believe) Dev Academy spends so much time focussing on the core skills. </p>
    <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time?</h2>
    <p>No, I can see the calue in it. Although I was aware of some of the concepts previously, it has been good to get a refresher on these. </p>
    <h2> Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
    <p>I guess it depends on what you use Dev Academy for - is it a) just to learn programming skills, or b) to prepare for the workforce. If b) then 
      it is valuable to spend time on the core skills too.
