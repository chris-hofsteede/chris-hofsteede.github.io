    <h1>Post Foundations Reflection</h1>
    <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
    <p>
      I am still undecided if I will go into fulltime web development after this
      course, as it would involve a significant change in career / salary. I may
      see if I can stay in my current role and incorporate more web development,
      alternatively, I could use my web development skills to work on side
      projects / hustles.
    </p>
    <h2>
      What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
      Bootcamp?
    </h2>
    <p>
      My biggest strength will be my ability, and curious mind. If I can think
      of a problem to solve, then I can solve it.
    </p>
    <h2>
      What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will
      be?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Keeping my self motivation strong. I would like to be motivated enough to
      always do the strech excercises, and to always go beyond what is asked of
      me. I would also like to focus more on getting things done in a timelay
      way, and not procrastinating or leaving thigns to the last minute.
    </p>
    <h2>
      What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed
      in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </h2>
    <p>
      I would like to see the lighter side in life, and to get better at deeply/
      strongly connecting with others. I think the listeneing and looping
      session has been really good for developing these skills, so I look
      forward to enhancing and developing these skills more.
    </p>
    <h2>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>
    <p>
      To facilite, to encourage and to mentor. I expect that the bootcamp staff
      will provide a safe space to learn, and to support us. I expect that there
      may be some uncomfortable conversations, and I would like to have these
      even if they are difficult.
    </p>
    <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>
    <p>
      To remain determined and focussed on learning. To challenge myself. My
      commitment is to push myself to the point of being uncomfortable to learn
      new things, and to develop really strong web development skills. I commit
      to engaging and working collaboratively with others, including students,
      mentors, and industry/community representatives.

    <h1>Pre Foundations Reflection</h1>

    <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>

    <p>
      My long term goals is to be fully competant and able to work on my own
      projects independently, and successfully. I have not yet decided whether I
      would like to work professionally/ formally as a web dev, mainlyt as it
      would mean a possible drop in salary, however I could be open to making
      the switch.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a personal level, I think the Web Dev skills will allow me to express
      my thoughts and ideas more easily, and with a bigger tool set.
    </p>

    <h2>
      A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
    </h2>

    <h2>Strengths</h2>
    <p>
      Able to understand complicated concepts - I have a strong analytical mind,
      which helps me to undersand tricky concepts and ideas and allows me to
      analyse issues and create solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know that there is a solution - and I'm good at finding it. I think a
      general awareness and knowledge that if something is difficult, that it
      can be resolved through hard work and determination.
    </p>

    <h2>Weaknesses</h2>
    <p>
      Committing to do hard work. I find it hard to force myself into doing
      difficult things, and getting started, or enduring on difficult problems.
      One reason for joining this Dev Academy course was to feel somewhat
      "forced" to sit down and learn. These materials are available for free
      online after all, but I needed the structured learning environment to get
      started. Perhaps being more a self-starter is a skill I am looking to
      develop. I think having some basic skills removes some of that friction
      from getting started.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keep issues to myself. I'm learning to open up, be vulnerable and share
      technical challenges that I face along the way.
    </p>
    <h2>
      What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
      developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </h2>

    <p>
      More of a self-starter attitude, and a willingness to knuckle down and do
      the hard work to achieve an outcome.
    </p>

    <p>
      Inter-personal relationships in the software industry, and ability to plan
      and co-ordinate work with others.
    </p>

    <h2>
      A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This
      should include: An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work
      productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and
      industry/community representatives What you will do when things are
      building up and starting to get to you A commitment as to how and where
      you will seek help in a timely way
    </h2>

    <p>
      On reflection, I think I can tend to bottle things up when I get stressed,
      or have a lot of things backing up. My commitment is to communicate these
      things clearly and calmly, so that I can get the support or space needed
      to work on things and get thigns completed.
    </p>
    <p>
      My commitment is to treat others with respect, even when it is difficult.
    </p>

    <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>

    <p>
      Regular engagement and check-ins. People to bounce ideas off, and give us
      feedback (both technical and soft skills). This has already started with
      the once per fortnight check-ins, and would also be great to get this
      one-on-one support if needed.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed
      to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like
      school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
    </h2>

    <p>
      Currently I am still working part-time, so I am having to factor in
      regular sessions of learning in my nights and weekends. Toggl has helped
      with tracking time. I have had to communicate more clearly with my wife
      when I need time and space to work on Dev Academy curriculum.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are expecting a baby in April. While I am taking time off work (so will
      have less work commitments), I will have more personal commitments as I
      transition to being a dad, and a supportive husband to my wife.
